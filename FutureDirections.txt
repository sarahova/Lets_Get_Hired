Future Directions:

1) Scraping
	- add multiprocessing

2) Text pre-processing
	- add lemmatization/stemming (get the root of each word)
		e.g. "researches" -> "research"
	- part of speech tagging
		i.e. what's a noun, verb, etc..

3) Text analysis
	- deep learning/training
		- infer/extract skills instead of hardcoding/finding
		- probably need to manually label a training dataset

4) front-end / deploy
	- streamlit or plotly/dash
	- deploy with heroku or digital ocean
	- add functionality for city search
